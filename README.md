![Polyline: Polyline encoding/decoding in Swift](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raphaelmor/Polyline/assets/polyline.png)

Polyline encoder / decoder in Swift

## Features

- Encode a CLLocation array to a polyline
- Decode a polyline to an Array of CLLocation
- Encode/Decode associated levels (optional)
- 100% Unit Test Coverage
- Complete Documentation

### Planned for 1.0.0

- Convert to `MKPolyline`
- Example project

### Planned for future releases 

- Convert to `GMSPolyline`
- Filter locations available at a specific level

### Planned when support is available :

- Distribute as a [CocoaPod](http://cocoapods.org)
- Continuous integration with [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org)
- Code Coverage with [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io)


## Requirements

- Xcode 6 Beta 7
- iOS 7.0+ / Mac OS X 10.9+

---

## Usage

### Polyline Encoding

```swift
let polyline = Polyline(locations: locations)
let encodedPolyline : String = polyline.encodedPolyline
```

### Polyline Decoding

```swift
let polyline = Polyline(polyline: "_p~iF~ps|U_ulLnnqC_mqNvxq`@")
let decodedLocations : Array<CLLocation>? = polyline.locations
```
        
### Note
This library tries to have consistent results with polylines generated by the [Google Maps iOS SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/).
The online tool for [encoding polylines](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylineutility) has some minor inconsistencies regarding rounding (for example, 0.000015 is rounded to 0.00002 for latitudes, but 0.00001 for longitudes).
